## :arrows_counterclockwise: Contribution process overview
1. Getting Started
2. Create new issue / select an existing issue
3. Create new branch
4. Commit your changes
5. Validate / Run tests
6. Create new pull request
7. Code Review


## :arrow_right: Getting started
The best way to get started is by reading the [README](/README.md). It contains links to all other parts of the project
documentation, like the [ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md) documentation for example, where one can also find an overview
of the projects file structure.


## :clipboard: Issues
Before being able to contribute to B01LER, you need to get yourself assigned to an issue. For this you could either
apply to solve an existing issue or create a new issue.

### Solve an existing issue
Browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/deven-org/boiler/issues) to find one that interests you. If you would
like to work on an issue, leave a comment stating your intent and assign yourself to the issue. If the issue already has
an assignee, someone else is likely already working on it. The core team will check your issue to ensures that it is
still relevant and give you approval to start working. Waiting for approval makes it less likely to get a rejected pull
request. We will do our best to reply to you within a week.

### Create a new issue
Before creating a new issue, please [check if your issue already exists](https://github.com/deven-org/boiler/issues). If
a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using the same page. We currently have two issue templates. One
is for bugs and the other one for everything else, like new features or also improvements of existing features.

<details>
<summary>How to write a useful issue?</summary>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Use the existing issue templates.</li>
<li>It should be <i>specific</i>. It's important that it addresses one specific topic.</li>
<li>If it is a bug it should be <i>reproducible</i>. It should contain all the instructions needed to reproduce the same outcome.</li>
<li>If the issue is about a component, please add the component name to the beginning of issue title, followed by a dash and a more in detail description of the issue. For example: <code>Button Text - add new variant</code>.</li>
</ul>
</details>
After creating an issue, don‚Äôt forget to assign it to yourself. The core team will then check your issue to ensures that your idea fits the scope of the project and leave an approval comment. Waiting for approval makes it less likely to get a rejected pull request.  We will do our best to reply to new issues within a week.

### Tips to find issues
- For a first contribution, go to labels / filter by labels and see if there are issues tagged with the
  `good first issue` label.
- Search for the component name of the component you want to work on.
- Filter by the `üíö contributor issue` label.
- Filter by the `üö® new::bug`, `‚å®Ô∏è dev issue`, `üìã task::backlog` and/or `üìã task::ready` labels.
- Avoid tasks labeled with `‚≠ïÔ∏è core team issue`, `üö´ blocker`, `üé® design issue`, `üìã task::planned`,
  `üìã task::inProgress`, `üìã task::inReview`, `ü¶π needs:contact`, `ü¶π needs:documentation`, `ü¶π needs:help` and/or
  `ü¶π needs:specs`.


## :arrow_heading_down: Branch
For contributions we are using
[Gitflow as branching strategy](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow#:~:text=Gitflow%20is%20a%20legacy%20Git,software%20development%20and%20DevOps%20practices).
[Here](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) you can also find a short cheatsheet about Gitflow.

### Branch naming convention
The branch name should not exceed a maximum character count of 140. Each branch should follow the following structure:
`<branchType>/<issueNumber>_<summary>`

- **branchType:** As defined in the Gitflow branching strategy, there are different types of branches. Besides the
  existing `main` and `develop` branches, the allowed types for newly created branches are: `release`, `hotfix`,
  `feature` and `fix`. The branch type `fix` is not defined in Gitflow, but is used exactly like a `feature` branch. It
  was added to be more granular in our naming convention and to differentiate between branches that implement something
  new (`feature`) and those that change something that already exists (`fix`).
- **issueNumber:** The issue number of your task. For example: `421`.
- **summary:** A few words describing the issue. When there are multiple words, you can use a hyphen to link the words.
  For example: `text-area-storybook-documentation`.


## :handshake: Commits
The commits must be compliant with with the
[Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The commit header should not
exceed a maximum character count of 140. The scope is allowed to be one of the following options: 'all', 'ui-library',
'icons', 'figma-design-tokens', 'tokens', or 'storybook'.


## :test_tube: Testing and validating
Please, before submitting any contribution, be sure that your branch is passing all the tests.

```bash
yarn test
yarn build:ui-library
```


## :mag: Pull requests & Code reviews
Once you are happy with your implementation, all the acceptance criteria of your issue are solved and all tests are 
passing, it is time to open a pull request (PR). After doing so, your code will be reviewed by the B01LER core team. 
Once the PR has two approvals, your code will be merged to develop and will be part of a future release. 

In case we find things we would like you to change we will leave comments. We kindly ask you to update your pull request 
in regards to the requested changes. Once all comments have been solved, the pull request will be merged. We will try 
our best to respond within a week to new pull requests. 

Contributors are also invited to review other contributors pull requests, but in the end at least one member of the core 
team needs to approve it, before it can be merged.

### Tips for working on a pull request
- Create pull requests for the `develop` branch and not for `main`.
- Make sure that a pull request is linked to the related issue by using a keyword and the issue number as
explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)
or by using the `Development` field.
- Check off the acceptance criteria of the issue you are working on to track your progress (does not apply to bug issues).
- Change your PR from `Draft` to `Ready for Review`, when all acceptance criteria are met and all tests are passing (you
can create Draft PRs at any time, but only open PRs will be reviewed).
- Leave the reviewers list on the right hand side untouched. We use this to track how many people are already looking at
your PR.
- Assign the label needs:reviewers (code) or needs:reviewers (design).
- (only for members of the core team) During iteration: Stay in touch with the reviewers that are on your case.
- (only for members of the Accenture Slack Channel) Post a link to the PR in the [#boiler-dev](https://song-asg.slack.com/archives/C0629BCDCSK)
Slack channel if the review is time critical.

### Steps for looking for a pull request to review
1. Find a PR:
  - (only for Members of the Accenture Slack Channel) Keep an eye on posted PR links in the #boiler-dev Slack channel.
  - Filter the [PR list in GitHub](https://github.com/deven-org/boiler/pulls) for label: `ü¶π needs:reviewers (code)` or label: `ü¶π needs:reviewers (design)`.
2. Open the PR of your choice.
3. Check the Reviewers panel to the right. Are enough reviewers on the case already (dev:2, design: 1)? If so choose a
different PR. Otherwise proceed with (Step 4.).
4. Request yourself as a Reviewer in the Reviewers panel to the right.
5. Update the labels:
  - If you are the second code reviewer, remove the label `ü¶π needs:reviewers (code)`.
  - If you are the first design reviewer, remove the label  `ü¶π needs:reviewers (design)`.
6. Complete the Review.
7. Follow-up on your review.
  - During iteration: Check your assigned PRs regulary or stay in touch with the PR creator.
  - If you‚Äôre unsure about whether you‚Äôll be able to complete the review in a timely manner remove yourself from the
    list of reviewers & re-attach the label.
