## Requirements

Please list all the requirements the user has to fullfill to be able to run your code. Consider adding links to other
tech documentations of possible dependencies to help users meet the requirements.We've added two examples of how you

- yarn (any version, we will pick the right settings later)

- corepack (might need to be installed additionally)

## How to start

In this section you're supposed to provide the user with a step by step guide on how to install and use your project.
We've added an example below to give you an idea of how you could structure your guide.

1. First, create a folder and a package.json file

   ```sh
   $ mkdir my-app
   $ cd my-app
   $ npm init -y
   ```

2. now we enable corepack for yarn and chooose right version

   ```sh
   $ corepack enable
   $ yarn set version 4.x
   ```
