## :star: Introduction
B01LER is a fully customisable design system (DS) that enables you to easily create cohesive and consistent digital products across multiple platforms and brands.

B01LER provides pre-built components that exist in design in the form of a [component library in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/kG44mSWhEp2VcMvMqbJrRY/B01LER-%5Bv0.2--alpha-release%5D?type=design&node-id=1134%3A44297&mode=design&t=ZatzD7omF9pxalvP-1) (the link to the Figma file above is exclusively for members of the Accenture organization, while those outside the organization can download the file [here](https://boilerds.com/B01LER%20[v0.2%20-alpha%20release].fig)), as well as in code in a repository (the one you have opened right now), which is also [displayed in the web using Storybook](https://b01ler.onrender.com/). Both the components in design and in code are connected via a token system.

A token system is a collection of values which represent the visual properties of a design system, such as typography, color and spacing.

Utilizing tokens, B01LER is simultaneously consistent and flexible. By changing the tokens, you have the power to change the appearance of the whole design, including all the components and all the digital products build with it. In Figma and in code.

Overall, B01LER is a powerful tool that helps you work smarter, not harder. By streamlining the design and development processes B01LER empowers you to create better products faster.

### Benefits of B01LER
1. Increased efficiency in building design systems on brand, because semantic structure and architecture are pre-built
2. Increased efficiency, through automated processes. Documentation, DEV Handover, and more
3. Increased effectivity, because the time saved on building all the components can be used to build features right away
4. Increased acceptance of DS because components work right from the beginning of project phase
5. Immense cost savings, because the DS ramp-up phase is reduced from multiple months to days

### Common misconceptions
#### Accessibility of Web Components
Some articles claim, that Web Components are not accessible or that they are not complying with standard accessibility guidelines. The argument says that assistive technologies like screenreaders can not access the shadow DOM and for example are not able to "see" aria or role attributes that are needed to make components accessible. This is wrong. Modern screenreaders are not "looking" at the DOM. Instead they are accessing the accessibility tree, which is provided by the browser and also contains information from the shadow DOM.

## :triangular_ruler: Architecture
Get to know about our Architecture [here](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## :gear: Requirements
1. First you need to install Git. Git is needed to clone the project to your local machine. If you don't have it installed yet you can follow this [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. This project is a Node.js package. You need Node Version 18 or higher in order to run it. Check your installed version with node -v. For more information check out the [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).
3. If you don't have Yarn installed, please install it (any version, we will pick the right settings later). For more information check out the [Yarn Documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs).

In addition, you might need to install Corepack. For more information checkout [Corepack Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html).


### Figma
Figma is a collaborative tool used for designing user interfaces. Figma can be run on any operating system that can run a browser which can help designers, developers and various other stakeholders to collaborate seamlessly. Sharing designs, managing permissions on a granular level and requesting feedback are some of the many features that help teams work in a more agile fashion.

### Tokens Studio
Tokens Studio for Figma (also known as Figma Tokens) is a plugin for Figma that allows users to integrate design tokens into their Figma designs.
Before you start working with B01LER Design System for Figma, make sure to install the Tokens Studio for Figma (Figma Tokens) plugin so you can access and customize the UI kit easily.

The plugin allows both designers and developers to inspect tokens that have been applied to components. An overview of all tokens for a component can be viewed with deep inspect or the specific tokens used for the building blocks of a component can also be viewed 

## :arrow_forward: How to start

### Installation
> **Note:** You need to run terminal as administrator on Windows machines.

1. First, open a terminal and navigate to the folder you want to fork or clone this project

   ```sh
   $ cd git_projects
   ```

2. If you want to use B01LER as a starting point for your own design system, the first step is to fork the repository. You can do this via the GitHub web interface and just follow the instructions or read the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).   This step is only required for the initial setup of you repository.

   In case you want to contribute to this repository, the first step is to clone the repository:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/deven-org/boiler.git
   ```

3. Now we enable corepack for yarn and choose right version

   ```sh
   $ corepack enable
   $ yarn set version 4.0.2
   ```

4. Next, install the app

   ```sh
   $ yarn
   ```

5. Now start up your app

   ```sh
   $ yarn start
   ```

> Note: This command will also open up Storybook locally. This provides you with a full list of available components that you can experiment with. Each component in Storybook also contains detailed documentation how to use them and the parameters that they can accept.

### Setup

> Note: To be able to edit tokens, you must own a pro license of token studio

1. First, open your Copy of the B01LER and bookmark Tokens Studio in the Plugins panel.
2. Launch Tokens Studio using 'New Empty File' since no tokens have been defined yet.
3. Connect your repository to Tokens Studio. First, generate and copy a new Personal Access Token in Github. You can use either Tokens (Classic) or 'Fine-grained tokens'. Next, use the copied token to add GitHub as a Sync Provider. Click the 'Settings tab' in Tokens Studio and in the 'Add new menu', select GitHub. Use the Personal Token that you copied to authenticate yourself and to connect your cloned B01LER repository.
4. If the entered credential are correct you will be asked to Pull from git. Please accept this dialog. The tokens tab should now contain all tokens sets of B01LER available.

Please refer to the 'Getting Started' section in our [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/kG44mSWhEp2VcMvMqbJrRY/B01LER-%5Bv0.2--alpha-release%5D?type=design&node-id=1134%3A44297&mode=design&t=ZatzD7omF9pxalvP-1) (the link to the Figma file above is exclusively for members of the Accenture organization, while those outside the organization can download the file [here](https://boilerds.com/B01LER%20[v0.2%20-alpha%20release].fig)) for more detailed instructions on how to set up the library, configure Figma Tokens Studio and customize the project assets to meet your requirements.

The 'Getting Started' section also explains the logic behind our token names and enable you to find and change the right tokens when rebranding B01LER or when you want to extend or change some functionality of a component.

## :white_check_mark: How to test
Learn about our testing approach [here](./doc/TESTING.md).

## :toolbox: How to build
> Note: Each command must be run from the root directory of the project

The B01LER UI Library can be built using the following command:

   ```sh
   $ yarn build:ui-library
   ```

B01LER can also be built with Storybook bundled alongside it which provides you with a sandbox to experiment with our components:

   ```sh
   $ yarn build:storybook
   ```

B01LER comes with an example vanilla JS application to demonstrate how easy it is to use components in your app. To build this example app, run the following command:

   ```sh
   $ yarn build:js-example
   ```

In the generated `dist` folder, the generated `index.html` file can be opened in the browser to preview our components.
